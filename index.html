      Choosing the right product category is the first strategic step for TikTok sellers. 
      This quadrant chart helps you explore the market by comparing two important signals: 
      <strong>average GMV</strong> (horizontal axis) and <strong>average video count</strong> (vertical axis) for each category.

      Use the two sliders to define what counts as “high” in your context. As thresholds move, 
      categories shift between four zones:

      <strong>Cash Cow</strong> (high GMV, high video activity),  
      <strong>Focused</strong> (high GMV, low video activity),  
      <strong>Potential</strong> (low GMV, high video activity), and  
      <strong>Weak</strong> (low GMV, low video activity).

      Bubble colors change automatically based on the zone, making it easy to spot which categories 
      deserve further exploration — whether you're looking for quick wins or long-term growth areas.

        To explore the underlying factors behind top-performing TikTok shops, we introduce three interactive visualisations.
        Each chart focuses on a different perspective — features distribution, trait composition, and pricing-GMV relationships.
        Use the <strong>Category Selector</strong> and <strong>Top N Toggle</strong> below to filter and analyse your focus groups.

          This <strong>boxplot</strong> shows the distribution of product counts among top and non-top shops. 
          It helps compare <strong>medians</strong>, measure variability, and identify unusual performers across shop types.
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart2" data-highlight="box-core">
          The central <strong>box area</strong> represents the interquartile range (IQR), covering the middle 50% of shops. 
          The bold <strong>horizontal line</strong> inside the box shows the <strong>median</strong> product count.
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart2" data-highlight="box-outliers">
          The <strong>dots</strong> outside the whiskers are <strong>outliers</strong> — shops with exceptionally high or low product counts. 
          These may indicate standout sellers or niche players.
        </div>
 
        <!-- Chart 3 explanations -->
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart3" data-highlight="none">
          This stacked bar chart compares <strong>top</strong> and <strong>non-top</strong> shops across three operational aspects: 
          <strong>creator collaboration</strong>, <strong>video production</strong>, and <strong>product variety</strong>. 
          These three factors reflect how actively a shop engages with the TikTok ecosystem and can jointly shape its viral potential and GMV performance.
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart3" data-highlight="stack-creator">
          One key success factor for top-performing shops is their extensive <strong>collaboration with creators</strong>. 
          By partnering with a larger number of influencers, these shops tap into diverse follower bases, gaining broader reach and increased social proof—key drivers of consumer trust and impulse purchases on TikTok.
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart3" data-highlight="stack-video">
          Another clear difference is in the <strong>volume of promotional videos</strong> they produce. 
          Top shops consistently generate more video content, increasing their exposure on the platform’s For You feed. 
          More videos mean more entry points for product discovery, higher chances of virality, and sustained engagement over time.
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart3" data-highlight="stack-product">
          Finally, top shops tend to offer a <strong>wider range of products</strong>. 
          A broad catalog not only attracts different consumer segments but also encourages repeat visits and cross-selling opportunities, ultimately contributing to higher total GMV and customer retention.
        </div>
 
        <!-- Chart 4 explanations -->
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart4" data-highlight="none">
          <p>
            This scatter plot shows the relationship between <strong>product price</strong> and <strong>shop GMV</strong>. 
            Each dot stands for a shop, <strong>Red dots</strong> highlight top-performing shops, while <strong>gray dots</strong> indicate others. 
            The chart reveals pricing patterns linked to stronger sales outcomes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart4" data-highlight="scatter-top">
          <p>
            Top-performing shops tend to cluster within a <strong>moderate price range</strong>, avoiding extremes.  
            This points to an <strong>optimal pricing zone</strong> that balances value and affordability—key to boosting GMV.
          </p>
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart4" data-highlight="scatter-low">
          <p>
            Shops with <strong>lower average prices</strong> are more likely to achieve higher GMV. 
            These are often volume-driven businesses that rely on mass-market appeal and impulse purchases.
          </p>
        </div>
 
        <div class="long-step" data-chart="chart4" data-highlight="scatter-high">
          <p>
            In contrast, <strong>higher-priced shops</strong> tend to underperform in terms of GMV, 
            possibly due to lower conversion rates or limited appeal within the TikTok ecosystem.

      <h3>Target High-Potential Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Insights from the quadrant chart reveal that categories with <strong>higher average GMV</strong> and <strong>more video activity</strong> tend to produce stronger shop performance.
        Choosing the right category not only aligns with TikTok’s content algorithm but also matches user interests, increasing visibility and sales potential.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Increase Product Variety and Content Output</h3>
      <p>
        Top-performing shops typically offer <strong>a broader range of products</strong> and maintain <strong>higher video output</strong>. 
        A wide catalog attracts diverse buyers, while frequent content helps keep the shop visible in TikTok’s recommendation system.
        Balancing inventory expansion with active content production is key to sustaining engagement and growth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Balance Pricing Within Category Context</h3>
      <p>
        The scatter plot shows that shops with <strong>moderate unit prices</strong> tend to achieve better GMV.
        However, this pattern varies across categories — what is “moderate” in one category may be high in another.
        Identifying a price point that fits both <strong>category norms</strong> and <strong>consumer expectations</strong> is essential for maximizing conversions.
